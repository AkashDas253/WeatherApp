# Weather App üå§Ô∏è

## Overview

- **Hourly Forecast**: View hourly temperature and wind speed for the next few hours.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the city is not found or if there is an issue fetching the weather data.

## API Integration


This project uses two external APIs:

1.  **Open-Meteo API**: For fetching weather data. The API requires the latitude and longitude of the city to return weather information.
2.  **Nominatim API**: For geocoding city names to latitude and longitude.

## How It Works:

1.  User enters a city name and clicks "Search".
2.  The app uses Nominatim API to get the latitude and longitude of the city.
3.  The app then uses Open-Meteo API to fetch the weather data based on the latitude and longitude.
4.  The app displays the current weather and hourly forecast.

## Error Handling


The app handles the following errors:

-   **City Not Found**: If the city is not found, an error message is displayed.
-   **API Errors**: If there is an issue with fetching data from the APIs, an error message is displayed.
